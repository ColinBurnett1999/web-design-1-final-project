        <section id="about-description">
        <p>
          My name is Colin and I am currently a student of Graphic Design at
          Algonquin College. 
          </p>
          <p>
          Through my studies, I have developed a solid
          foundation in design principles and have gained experience with a
          variety of design tools, including Adobe Creative Suite (Photoshop,
          Illustrator, InDesign), Figma, and Sketch. 
          </p>
          <p>
          I am passionate about
          typography, layout design, and branding. I have also had the
          opportunity to experiment with other areas of design, such as motion
          graphics and web design.

              stunning and effective in representing your brand. $X,XXX

            <h3>Web Design</h3>
            <p>
              Your website is often the first interaction customers have with
              your business, so it's important to make a strong first
              impression. I can help you create a website that not only looks
              great but also functions flawlessly and engages your target

            <h3>Full Branding</h3>
            <p>
              Your brand is much more than just a logo or a website. It's the
              overall image that your business presents to the world, including
              the look, feel, and voice of your brand. I can help you create a
              cohesive and impactful brand that resonates with your target
              audience and sets you apart from your competitors. $X,XXX
